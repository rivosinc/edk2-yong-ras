/**
  Run a TVM VCPU

  Runs the VCPU specified by TvmVcpuId in the TVM specified by TvmGuestId. The TvmGuestId
  must be in a "runnable" state (requires a prior call to SbiCoVHFinalizeTvm()). The function
  does not return unless the TVM exits with a trap that cannot be handled by the TSM.

  Returns 0 on success in SBI_RET.Value if the TVM exited with a resumable VCPU interrupt or
  exception, and non-zero otherwise. In the latter case, attempts to call SbiCoVHRunTvmVcpu()
  with the same TvmVcpuId will fail.

  The TSM sets the most significant bit in scause to indicate that that the exit was caused by an
  interrupt, and if this bit is clear, the implication is that the exit was caused by an exception. The
  remaining bits specific information about the interrupt or exception, and the specific reason can be
  determined using the enum TVM_INTERRUPT_EXIT an TVM_EXCEPTION

  @param[in] TvmGuestId       The Tvm Guest Id.
  @param[in] TvmVcpuId        The Vcpu ID.

  @param[out]                 SBI_RET.Error value as described below:
                                SBI_COVE_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
                                SBI_COVE_ERR_INVAL_PARAM: TvmGuestId or TvmVcpuId was invalid, or
                                                    the TVM wasn't in TVM_RUNNABLE state.
                                SBI_COVE_ERR_FAILED: The operation failed for unknown reasons.
                              SBI_RET.Value returns 0 on success if the interrupt or exception is
                                                    resumable. The host can examine scause to
                                                    determine details. Non-zero otherwise.
